# This is a Fork of PokÃ©mon FireRed and LeafGreen by Pret
based on https://github.com/pret/pokefirered

I wanted to play this game a long time but there were some 'time waster' functions which really annoyed me. 
Then i found out that i can make changes as i wish to thanks to https://github.com/pret and his community: 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/d5dubZ3) and [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?#pret).

I wanted the stock story and game experience (v1.1) without:
 1) text animation character by character -> instant text mode
 2) skipping the battle intro, but only the part where the main hero throws the pokeball
 3) skipping the goodbye text in the healath care center 

I also need to say a huge thanks to https://github.com/Deokishisu with his https://github.com/Deokishisu/FRLG-Plus
repo, which contained the stuff i needed (among lot more) in some form.


To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), or wisit the original author's page.
